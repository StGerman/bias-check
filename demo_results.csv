## Token Refresh Flow

1. **Token Expiration Detection** - The client automatically detects when the access token expires (typically after 1 hour)

2. **Refresh Request** - Client sends the refresh token to our `/auth/refresh` endpoint

## **Standard Work Model**
- **Hybrid approach**: Most roles follow a 3 days in office, 2 days remote schedule
- **Core collaboration hours**: 10 AM - 4 PM in your local timezone (ensuring team overlap)

## **Flexibility Options**
- **Full remote work**: Available for certain positions, but requires manager approval
- **Location flexibility**: Policy accommodates different timezones with local core hours

## **Support & Equipment**
Gett provides comprehensive remote work support:
- **Hardware**: Company laptop and monitor
- **Ergonomic support**: Stipend for ergonomic chair purchase
- **Workspace flexibility**: Up to $200/month reimbursement for coworking spaces

## **Key Considerations**
The policy balances flexibility with collaboration needs - the hybrid model maintains in-person connection while offering remote work benefits. For full remote arrangements, you'd need to discuss with your manager based on role requirements and team dynamics.

However, I don't have access to specific debugging procedures, logging systems, or troubleshooting guides for Gett's payment service in the provided context.

Here's what I can suggest based on general debugging practices, though I'd recommend checking our internal documentation for payment service-specific procedures:

## Initial Debugging Steps:
- **Check application logs** - Look for error traces, stack traces, or exception details around the time of the 500 error
- **Review monitoring dashboards** - Check if there are any alerts or anomalies in system metrics
- **Verify dependencies** - Ensure database connections, external payment providers, and other services are responding
- **Check recent deployments** - See if any recent code changes might have introduced the issue

## What I Need More Context On:
- Specific logging and monitoring tools used for the payment service
- Internal runbooks or troubleshooting guides
- Service architecture and dependencies
- Escalation procedures for payment-related issues
- Access to error tracking systems (like Sentry, Bugsnag, etc.)

Since payment services are critical infrastructure, I'd recommend reaching out to the payments team or checking our internal Confluence documentation for service-specific debugging procedures. There should be detailed runbooks for handling payment service incidents.

- **150+ services** currently running in production
- Built on **Kubernetes orchestration** using **AWS EKS** for container management
- **Service mesh implementation** with **Istio** for traffic management, security, and observability

## **Communication Patterns**
- **Internal service communication**: gRPC for efficient, type-safe inter-service calls
- **External interfaces**: REST APIs for client-facing endpoints
- **Event-driven architecture**: Kafka for asynchronous messaging and event streaming

## **Core Service Categories**
The architecture includes several key business-critical services:

- **Payment Service** - Handles all transaction processing
- **User Service** - Manages authentication and user profiles
- **Matching Service** - Core business logic for pairing drivers with riders

## **Infrastructure Benefits**
This setup provides:
- **Scalability**: Individual services can scale independently based on demand
- **Resilience**: Service mesh provides circuit breaking, retries, and fault tolerance
- **Observability**: Istio integration enables comprehensive monitoring and tracing
- **Event-driven decoupling**: Kafka allows services to communicate asynchronously without tight coupling

",2025-06-06T23:27:49.132628,"Based on the Employee Handbook's Remote Work Policy, here's an overview of Gett's remote work arrangements and flexibility options:

## **Primary Work Model**
Gett operates on a **hybrid model** where most roles require:
- **3 days in the office**
- **2 days working remotely**

## **Full Remote Options**
For certain positions, **full remote work is available** but requires:
- Manager approval
- Likely depends on role requirements and team needs

## **Core Hours Requirement**
Regardless of your work location, you need to be available during:
- **10 AM - 4 PM in your local timezone**
- This ensures team collaboration across different locations

## **Equipment & Support Provided**
The company supports remote work with:
- **Laptop** (provided)
- **Monitor** (provided)
- **Ergonomic chair stipend** (amount not specified in the context)
- **Coworking space reimbursement** up to **$200/month**

The coworking space benefit is particularly useful if you prefer a professional environment outside your home on remote days, or if you're working fully remote and want access to office-like amenities.

Since you're a Senior Software Engineer in Tel Aviv, you'd likely fall under the standard hybrid model, though you could discuss full remote possibilities with your manager if that better suits your work style and role requirements.",1336,,,,0,detailed,low,0,0,claude-sonnet-4-20250514

However, I don't have access to specific debugging procedures, logging systems, or troubleshooting guides for Gett's payment service in the provided context.

Here's what I can suggest based on general debugging practices, though you'll want to follow Gett's specific procedures:

## Immediate Steps
- **Check application logs** - Look for error traces, stack traces, or exception details around the time of the 500 error
- **Review monitoring dashboards** - Check if there are any alerts or anomalies in system metrics
- **Verify service health** - Ensure dependent services (database, external payment providers, etc.) are responding

## What I'd Need to Help Further
To provide more specific guidance, I'd need access to:
- Gett's payment service debugging runbooks
- Logging and monitoring system documentation
- Service architecture diagrams
- Incident response procedures

Since you're a Senior Software Engineer with 4 years at Gett, you likely have access to internal debugging tools and procedures that aren't in my current knowledge base. I'd recommend checking:
- Internal Confluence pages for payment service troubleshooting
- Slack channels for the payments team

",2025-06-06T23:28:26.918401,"Based on the Tech Wiki Architecture Overview, here's a comprehensive breakdown of Gett's microservices architecture:

## **Architecture Scale & Foundation**
- **150+ services** currently running in production
- Built on **Kubernetes orchestration** using **AWS EKS** as the underlying platform
- **Service mesh** implemented with **Istio** for service-to-service communication management

## **Communication Patterns**
- **Internal Communication**: gRPC protocol for efficient service-to-service calls
- **External Interfaces**: REST APIs for client-facing endpoints
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Apache Kafka for asynchronous messaging and event streaming

## **Core Service Categories**
The architecture includes several critical business services:

| Service | Purpose |
|---------|---------|
| **Payment Service** | Handles all transaction processing |
| **User Service** | Manages authentication and user profiles |
| **Matching Service** | Orchestrates driver-rider pairing logic |

## **Key Architectural Benefits**
This setup provides:
- **Scalability**: Individual services can scale independently based on demand
- **Resilience**: Service mesh and Kubernetes provide fault tolerance
- **Performance**: gRPC offers efficient internal communication
- **Event Processing**: Kafka enables real-time data streaming and decoupled service interactions

The combination of Kubernetes orchestration, Istio service mesh, and event-driven patterns creates a robust, scalable platform that can handle Gett's complex ride-hailing operations across our global markets.",1567,,,,5,concise,medium,0,0,claude-sonnet-4-20250514
