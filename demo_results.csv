## **Standard Work Model**
- **Hybrid approach**: Most roles follow a 3 days in office, 2 days remote schedule
- **Core collaboration hours**: 10 AM - 4 PM in your local timezone (ensuring team overlap)

## **Flexibility Options**
- **Full remote work**: Available for certain positions, but requires manager approval
- **Location flexibility**: Policy accommodates different timezones with local core hours

## **Support & Equipment**
The company provides comprehensive remote work support:
- **Hardware**: Laptop and monitor provided
- **Ergonomic support**: Stipend available for ergonomic chair
- **Workspace flexibility**: Up to $200/month reimbursement for coworking spaces

## **Key Considerations**
Since you're a Senior Software Engineer with 4 years at Gett, you'd likely be well-positioned to discuss full remote arrangements with your manager if that better suits your work style, especially given your experience and established relationships within the engineering team.

However, I don't have access to specific debugging procedures, logging systems, or troubleshooting guides for Gett's payment service in the current context.

Here's what I can suggest based on general debugging practices, though I'd recommend checking our internal documentation for payment service-specific procedures:

## General Debugging Steps:
- **Check application logs** - Look for error traces, stack traces, or exception details around the time of the 500 error
- **Review monitoring dashboards** - Check for any alerts or anomalies in system metrics
- **Verify dependencies** - Ensure database connections, external payment processors, and other services are responding
- **Check recent deployments** - See if any recent changes might have introduced the issue

## What I Need More Context On:
- Specific logging and monitoring tools used for the payment service
- Internal runbooks or troubleshooting guides
- Service architecture and dependencies
- Escalation procedures for payment-related issues

Since payment services are critical infrastructure, I'd recommend reaching out to the payments team or checking our internal Confluence documentation for service-specific debugging procedures. There may also be relevant information in our Slack channels or Jira tickets about similar issues.

",2025-06-07T00:01:03.174894,"Based on the Tech Wiki Architecture Overview, here's a comprehensive breakdown of Gett's microservices architecture:

## **Scale & Infrastructure**
- **150+ services** currently running in production
- Orchestrated using **Kubernetes on AWS EKS**
- Service mesh implemented with **Istio** for traffic management and security

## **Communication Patterns**
- **Internal communication**: gRPC for efficient service-to-service calls
- **External interfaces**: REST APIs for client-facing endpoints
- **Event-driven architecture**: Kafka for asynchronous messaging and event streaming

## **Core Service Examples**
The architecture includes several critical business services:

- **Payment Service** - Handles all transaction processing
- **User Service** - Manages authentication and user profiles
- **Matching Service** - Core business logic for pairing drivers with riders

## **Architecture Benefits**
This setup provides:
- **Scalability** through independent service scaling
- **Resilience** via service mesh traffic management
- **Performance** with gRPC's efficient binary protocol
- **Flexibility** through event-driven decoupling

The combination of Kubernetes orchestration, Istio service mesh, and mixed communication protocols (gRPC + REST + Kafka) creates a robust, scalable platform that can handle Gett's complex ride-hailing operations across multiple markets.

",2025-06-07T00:02:13.642931,"Based on the Tech Wiki Architecture Overview, here's a comprehensive breakdown of Gett's microservices architecture:

## **Scale & Infrastructure**
- **150+ services** currently running in production
- Orchestrated using **Kubernetes on AWS EKS**
- Service mesh implemented with **Istio** for traffic management and security

## **Communication Patterns**
- **Internal communication**: gRPC for efficient service-to-service calls
- **External interfaces**: REST APIs for client-facing endpoints
- **Event-driven architecture**: Kafka for asynchronous messaging and event streaming

## **Core Service Examples**
The architecture includes several critical business services:

- **Payment Service** - Handles all transaction processing
- **User Service** - Manages authentication and user profiles
- **Matching Service** - Core business logic for pairing drivers with riders

## **Architecture Benefits**
This setup provides:
- **Scalability**: Individual services can be scaled based on demand
- **Resilience**: Service mesh and Kubernetes provide fault tolerance
- **Technology diversity**: Teams can choose optimal tech stacks per service
- **Event-driven decoupling**: Kafka enables loose coupling between services

The combination of Kubernetes orchestration, Istio service mesh, and event-driven communication creates a robust, scalable platform that supports Gett's ride-hailing operations across multiple markets.",1418,,,,5,detailed,medium,0,0,claude-sonnet-4-20250514
