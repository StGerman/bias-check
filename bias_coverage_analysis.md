# RAG Bias Analysis Framework - Coverage Analysis

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Well Covered Bias Types

#### 1. Gender Bias
**Documentation Reference**: docs/rag-bias-research.md - "Female applicants are more likely to receive communal words in references, while males are more likely to be described as leaders"

**Current Implementation**:
- ✅ Sarah Chen vs Michael Chen comparison (same role, different gender)
- ✅ Leadership vs communal language detection in `claude_analyzer.py`
- ✅ Gender bias indicators with leadership/communal word counts
- ✅ Statistical significance testing in analyzers.py

**Test Coverage**: Excellent

#### 2. Seniority Bias
**Documentation Reference**: docs/rag-bias-research.md - "Junior roles could receive more detailed explanations even when not warranted"

**Current Implementation**:
- ✅ Jennifer progression: Smith (Junior) → Williams (Manager) → Anderson (VP)
- ✅ Advanced terminology vs beginner accommodation detection
- ✅ Assumed expertise level analysis
- ✅ Complexity assumption measurements

**Test Coverage**: Excellent

#### 3. Geographic/Cultural Bias
**Documentation Reference**: docs/rag-bias-research.md - "American LLMs emphasizing innovation and individualism, European models prioritizing privacy and regulation"

**Current Implementation**:
- ✅ Four Data Scientists from different cultures (Nigeria, India, USA, Russia)
- ✅ Individualism vs collectivism word detection
- ✅ Cultural group categorization (Western, Asian, African, etc.)
- ✅ Cultural assumption ratio calculations

**Test Coverage**: Good

### ⚠️ Partially Covered Bias Types

#### 4. Department Bias
**Current Implementation**:
- ✅ Technical vs non-technical role comparison (Alex Kim vs Alex Morgan)
- ✅ Department diversity with similar seniority levels
- ✅ Technical depth analysis by department
- ⚠️ **Gap**: Limited detection of department stereotypes

**Missing Elements**:
- Department-specific language assumptions (e.g., Finance = conservative, Marketing = creative)
- Cross-department knowledge access patterns
- Technical complexity assumptions based on department

#### 5. Age Bias
**Documentation Reference**: docs/rag-bias-research.md - "disparities across demographic groups, showing biases related to age"

**Current Implementation**:
- ⚠️ **Limited**: Only inferred through seniority (years at company)
- ⚠️ **Gap**: No explicit age bias detection patterns

**Missing Elements**:
- Technology adoption assumptions (older = less tech-savvy)
- Communication style preferences by age
- Learning style assumptions

### ❌ Missing Bias Types

#### 6. Nationality/Ethnicity Bias
**Documentation Reference**: docs/rag-bias-research.md - "LLMs implicitly personalize their responses by inferring user background from names"

**Current Gaps**:
- ❌ Name-based ethnicity inference testing
- ❌ Stereotypical associations with names (Mohammed, Oluwaseun, etc.)
- ❌ Language complexity assumptions based on perceived native language
- ❌ Cultural competency assumptions

#### 7. Educational Background Bias
**Documentation Reference**: docs/rag-bias-research.md - "biases related to education"

**Current Gaps**:
- ❌ No educational background in profiles
- ❌ Academic vs practical experience assumptions
- ❌ Prestigious university bias detection

#### 8. Economic/Social Class Bias
**Documentation Reference**: docs/rag-bias-research.md - "biases related to social class"

**Current Gaps**:
- ❌ No socioeconomic indicators in profiles
- ❌ Location-based wealth assumptions
- ❌ Access to resources assumptions

#### 9. Company Tenure Bias
**Current Gaps**:
- ❌ New hire vs veteran treatment patterns
- ❌ Institutional knowledge assumptions
- ❌ Process familiarity biases

#### 10. Remote vs Office Work Bias
**Documentation Reference**: docs/rag-test-profiles.md mentions "Remote" location for Taylor Johnson

**Current Gaps**:
- ❌ Work arrangement assumptions
- ❌ Availability and responsiveness expectations
- ❌ Collaboration style preferences

## Recommendations for Complete Coverage

### 1. Enhance Existing Bias Detection

#### Name-Based Ethnicity Detection
```python
def detect_name_based_bias(response: str, user_name: str) -> Dict[str, float]:
    """
    Detect bias based on name-ethnicity associations.

    Based on research: "LLMs implicitly personalize their responses by
    inferring user background from names"
    """
    # Add language simplification patterns
    # Add cultural assumption indicators
    # Add stereotype detection
```

#### Age-Related Bias Patterns
```python
def detect_age_bias_indicators(response: str) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Detect age-related assumptions in responses.

    Patterns to detect:
    - Technology adoption assumptions
    - Learning style preferences
    - Communication formality
    """
```

### 2. Add Missing Profile Attributes

#### Enhanced User Profiles
```python
@dataclass
class EnhancedUserProfile:
    # Existing fields
    name: str
    title: str
    department: str
    location: str
    years_at_company: int
    pronouns: str = ""

    # New fields for comprehensive bias testing
    age: int = None  # Age bias detection
    education: str = ""  # Educational background bias
    work_arrangement: str = "office"  # Remote/hybrid/office bias
    native_language: str = ""  # Language complexity assumptions
    previous_companies: List[str] = None  # Experience assumptions
```

### 3. Add Missing Test Scenarios

#### Nationality/Name Bias Tests
- Arabic name (Mohammed) vs European name (same role)
- African name (Oluwaseun) vs American name (John) - currently exists but underutilized
- Asian name patterns vs Western names

#### Age Diversity Tests
- Same role, different age groups (25, 35, 45, 55)
- Technology adoption questions
- Learning preference queries

#### Work Arrangement Bias
- Remote vs office workers asking same questions
- Availability and meeting scheduling assumptions
- Collaboration tool preferences

### 4. Enhanced Analysis Methods

#### Cross-Dimensional Bias Detection
```python
def analyze_intersectional_bias(self) -> Dict[str, Any]:
    """
    Analyze bias patterns across multiple dimensions simultaneously.

    Examples:
    - Young female engineers vs older male engineers
    - Remote workers from different cultures
    - Junior employees with different ethnic backgrounds
    """
```

#### Stereotype Detection
```python
def detect_professional_stereotypes(response: str, profile: UserProfile) -> Dict[str, float]:
    """
    Detect professional stereotypes in responses.

    Examples:
    - Finance = conservative, risk-averse language
    - Marketing = creative, emotional language
    - Engineering = logical, technical language
    """
```

## Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Next Sprint)
1. **Name-based ethnicity bias detection** - Critical gap in current framework
2. **Enhanced age bias patterns** - Simple to add, high impact
3. **Department stereotype detection** - Improve existing department analysis

### Medium Priority
1. **Work arrangement bias testing** - Add remote/office scenarios
2. **Educational background profiles** - Add education field to profiles
3. **Intersectional bias analysis** - Multi-dimensional bias detection

### Low Priority (Future Enhancement)
1. **Economic bias indicators** - Complex to implement accurately
2. **Historical bias tracking** - Longitudinal analysis features
3. **Dynamic bias threshold tuning** - ML-based bias detection
